1. For creating services you need to mention their input and output datatype under a 
srv file in srv directory in the source folder (src/srv)

2. you need to write the srv file in following format
int64 A
int64 B
---
int64 Sum

upper part is input and lower side is output


3. Add the build depend and exec depend in package.xml

  <build_depend>message_generation</build_depend>
  <exec_depend>message_runtime</exec_depend>


4. Then add "message_generation" package to the find_package block in CMakeLists.txt i.e.

find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
   roscpp
   rospy
   std_msgs
   message_generation
)

5. Also export the message_runtime dependency in catkin package block in CMakeLists.txt

catkin_package(
  ...
  CATKIN_DEPENDS message_runtime ...
  ...)

6. Add the .msg file name in the add_service_file block in CMakeLists.txt i.e.

add_service_files(
  FILES
  AddTwoInts.srv
)

7. Use rossrv show {msg_name} to show the type of srv you have made and can use rossrv commands on that srv
