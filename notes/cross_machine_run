1. To connect the robot machine to the workstation machine you need to mentuon 3 things in the bashrc file 
which will run at the starting if the bot starts working
2. The variables you need to set are
  On the workstation machine
    ROS_MASTER_URI= http://{DOMAIN_NAME}:{PORT_NUMBER}
    ROS_HOSTNAME= it is probably the ip itself if you have not configured the bots hostname separately or 
                    you can set it in the /etc/hosts files
    ROS_IP=ip of the robot machine  

if IP is static that is ok
Check if DHCP then you need to change the ip after every restart of your workstation machine
